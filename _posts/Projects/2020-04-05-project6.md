##### Overview

CRT_ROBO is a personal project of mine that is currently in the early development phase, aimed at integrating OpenAI's capabilities with Arduino technology. Initially, this project will focus on creating a robot capable of voice interaction, with the ability to display responses through relevant images and text. CRT_ROBO will leverage natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries, making it an engaging and interactive experience.

As the project progresses, additional features will be incrementally added during my free time and further into the future, as I continue to learn new things. These enhancements will include the ability to process its environment and provide its own input using various sensors. The ultimate goal is to scale up CRT_ROBO into a more complex and autonomous system, capable of advanced interactions and environmental awareness.

##### Why CRT_ROBO

"CRT" in CRT_ROBO stands for "Cathode Ray Tube," referencing the technology used in older televisions to emphasize the TV design of the robot's head. CRT_ROBO's aesthetic and design are heavily inspired by ROBO_HEAD, a character from Cytus II.
