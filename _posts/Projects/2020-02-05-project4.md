##### Overview

This mobile application was developed to conduct research aimed at improving the existing StaySafe application, with a focus on enhancing contact-tracing capabilities. The goal was to explore and experiment with various techniques and strategies to enhance functionality and user experience, particularly in the context of tracking and managing potential COVID-19 exposures.

The app offers a range of valuable features:

##### First-Time Users

- Users can sign up on the main menu page and choose their account type.
- Users can sign in and out at their discretion, with sessions retained if they do not log out and close the app.

-----

##### Account Type: Individual

- Users can create personal accounts, providing essential information such as name, contact number, age, and gender.
- Users may optionally upload a display picture using their file system or camera.
- A daily COVID-19 screening assessment prompt allows users to quickly assess their health status, indicating if they are at low or high risk for COVID-19 based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC recommendations</a>.
- After completing the assessment, a personalized QR code is generated, containing relevant personal information and assessment results.
- The app tracks users' interactions and locations to facilitate contact tracing, notifying users if they have been in proximity to someone who has reported a high risk for COVID-19.

-----

##### Account Type: Organization

- Organizations can create accounts by providing details such as organization name, email, contact number, and address.
- The account includes a QR code scan feature to determine visitors' COVID-19 risk levels (low or high) and to accept or reject their visits.
- Accepted visits are logged with basic visitor information, recording the date and time of each visit for future reference.
- Organizations can use the contact-tracing feature to monitor and manage potential exposure within their premises, enhancing safety for employees and visitors.

##### Other Details

The application was developed using Android Studio, with Firebase Authentication, Storage, and Realtime Database. Assets were borrowed from <a href="https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vectors/evolution-word-vectors.">VectorStock</a>.
