##### Overview

Through our research, our team identified several issues associated with binge-watching, particularly among Generation Z. To address these challenges, we developed Siopao & Chill, an innovative app designed to help users manage their time for watching, sleeping, eating, and exercising more effectively. This application was developed using C#.NET.

Siopao & Chill is a personal binge-watch tracker that not only monitors users’ watch time but also tracks food consumption during extended viewing periods. The app leverages cloud servers to collect and securely store user data, which is then presented through various visualizations such as bar and line graphs, as well as pie charts. These visual tools help users easily understand their habits and patterns.

In addition to tracking watch time and food intake, Siopao & Chill calculates average watch time and sleep hours, offering insights into how much time users spend on their favorite shows versus resting. Based on the collected data, the app provides personalized exercise recommendations tailored to each user’s needs, promoting a balanced lifestyle.

This project was awarded with Project-Based Learning Excellence Award for the Software Development Strand (S.Y. 2018-2019)
