##### Overview
Tower of Aquatica is a drag-and-drop game where the player, known as the Guardian, uses the mouse to collect currency, select plants for defense, and upgrade or sell plants. The key to success lies in the player's ability to react quickly with the mouse to strategically survive the robot hordes.

##### Tower of Aquatica Lore
Lore: In the year 30XX, water has dried up, leaving only one plant on Earth: the Tree of Aquatica. The Guardian defends this last plant against robots programmed to destroy it. Surprisingly, the Tree of Aquatica produces new plants that assist in defense. The Guardian is aided by the Greensmith, a friend who upgrades units for free but requires water, obtained from plants, to do so. The Guardian must continuously fend off the robots to protect the last source of water on Earth.

-----

##### Goal
Once the game starts, the player must immediately defend the Tower of Aquatica from waves of attacking robots. The goal is to protect the last remaining plant, Pachira Aquatica, by using its descendants—plants produced by the main tree—for as long as possible.

-----

##### Overall Objective
Defend against the robots for as long as possible.

-----

##### Other Details
Tower of Aquatica was developed for Water Conservation Month to raise awareness about water conservation while promoting the importance of plants in maintaining ecological balance. The game is entirely coded in Java and features 28 different plant designs, including 16 non-toxic and 12 toxic varieties, all based on real plants.
